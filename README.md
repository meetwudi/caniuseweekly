# CaniuseWeekly

A weekly news letter of latest browser compatibility changes.

# How does it work

CaniuseWeekly is automatically generated every week from the changes to [caniuse](http://caniuse.com). caniuse is a index of current browser compatibilities with modern web technologies.

We do this by pulling from [caniuse's GitHub repository](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse) and calculate diff every week, then compile it into an weekly issue.
